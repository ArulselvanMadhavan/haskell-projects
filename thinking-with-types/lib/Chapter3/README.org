* Variance
** Covariant
** Contravariant
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
   class Contravariant f where
     contramap :: (a -> b) -> f b -> f a
   #+END_SRC
** Invariant
   - Invariant map allows you to map a to b if and only if a and b are
     isomorphic.
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
   class Invariant f where
     invmap :: (a -> b) -> (b -> a) -> f a -> f b
   #+END_SRC
** Bifunctor
   - A type that is covariant in both arguments like Either and (,)
** Profunctor
   - A type that is contravariant in first argument but covariant in
     second argument is called profunctor.
