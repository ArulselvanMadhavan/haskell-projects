* Terms, Types and Kinds
** Kind system
   - /Terms/ and /Types/ are the fundamental building blocks.
   - /Terms/ are values. Exist at runtime.
   - /Types/ are sanity checks.
   - Fundamental building blocks for type level programming are
     /types/ and /kinds/
   - /Kinds/ can be loosely described as "types of types".
** Kind of "Types"
   - /TYPE/ is the kind of types. Historically, written as *.
   - Types that have kind as TYPE are value types.
** Constraint Kinds
   - /Constraint/ is the kind of any fully saturated typeclass.
