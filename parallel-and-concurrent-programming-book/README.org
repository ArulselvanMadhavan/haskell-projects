* Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell

** What to expect
   - Express parallelism in Haskell with the Eval monad and evaluation
     strategies.
   - Parallelize ordinary Haskell code with the Par monad
   - Parallel array based computations using the Repa library.
   - Accelerate library to run computations on GPU
   - Work with Basic interfaces for writing concurrent code.
   - Build trees of threads for larger and more complex programs.
   - Build High speed concurrent network servers.
   - Write distributed programs that run on multiple machines in a network.

** From Simon Marlow
   - Concurrency is built into the core of the system.
   - GHC has solid and lightning fast concurrency support.

** Tools
   - /Threadscope/ - Arch Linux users can install it from AUR.

** GHC Flags
   - /threaded/ - Use the threaded runtime
   - /O2/ - Use level 2 optimizations
   - /rtsopts/ - Allows Runtime system to tweaked by command line arguments.
   - /eventlog/ - Enables profiling of runtime systems.
