* Cabal Notes
** Installation Notes
   - Use ~Cabal~ over stack
   - ~Cabal~ on Arch will not run out of the box. Follow the
     instructions in [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Haskell#Static_linking][here]]
** Dependencies
   - Cabal has a single package store in each machine.(Similar to python)
   - Use ~cabal-sandbox~
     - Each project has a fully isolated package store.
     - But this builds the project dependencies even if a locally
       built version is already available in the same machine.
     - This duplicates builds and takes up filesystem space.
     - Enter ~nix-style~ local builds.
     - Nix style builds projects with isolated and cached dependencies.
     - To access nix style builds, prefix commands with "new".
     - For example:Format is ~cabal new-<commandname>~
** Build Types
   1. Simple
   2. Custom
** Cheat Sheet
   - Update cabal package list.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cabal update
   #+END_SRC
   - Useful for launching repl when the ~cabal~ file targets both
     library and executable.
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   cabal new-repl
   #+END_SRC
   - Cabal test
   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   cabal new-test all
   #+END_SRC
